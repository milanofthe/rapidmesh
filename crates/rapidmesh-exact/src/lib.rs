//! Exact arithmetic foundation: expansions, interval filters, indirect predicates.
//!
//! Both hard stages of rapidmesh stand on this crate: the exact mesh CSG
//! (arrangements with implicitly represented intersection points) and the CDT
//! boundary recovery (implicitly represented Steiner points). The shared
//! mechanism is staged sign evaluation of polynomial expressions over f64
//! inputs:
//!
//! 1. **Interval filter** ([`Interval`]): conservative interval arithmetic with
//!    one-ulp outward widening per operation. Fast; resolves the sign in the
//!    vast majority of non-degenerate cases.
//! 2. **Exact fallback** ([`Expansion`]): Shewchuk-style floating-point
//!    expansion arithmetic. Slow but exact; resolves every case.
//!
//! Geometric expressions (determinants, implicit-point coordinates) are written
//! once, generically over the [`Ring`] trait, and evaluated with either number
//! type — or with a rational type in tests, which serves as the correctness
//! oracle.
//!
//! Implicit points ([`Point3::Lpi`], [`Point3::Tpi`]) are represented by their
//! defining primitives (line/plane, three planes) and evaluated lazily as
//! homogeneous coordinates whose entries are polynomials in the input
//! coordinates — no constructed (rounded) coordinates ever enter a predicate.
//!
//! # Input domain
//!
//! The underlying predicates do not handle exponent overflow/underflow: input
//! coordinates must stay well inside ~[1e-142, 1e201] in magnitude. Builders
//! upstream normalize all geometry into a unit box, which satisfies this with
//! enormous margin.
//!
//! # Provenance (licensing)
//!
//! Everything here is implemented from publicly described methods: Shewchuk's
//! expansion arithmetic and predicates (1997 paper, public-domain reference
//! technique), and the indirect/implicit-point predicate concept as described
//! in the papers of Attene (2020) and Cherchi et al. (2022). No GPL/AGPL code
//! was consulted. The `geometry-predicates` dependency (MIT) provides the fast
//! adaptive path for fully explicit predicates.
