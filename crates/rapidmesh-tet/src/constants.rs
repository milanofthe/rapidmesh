//! Central tuning constants for the tet mesher.
//!
//! Every numeric knob that shapes mesher BEHAVIOUR (sampling densities, relaxation
//! iteration caps, quality thresholds, spatial-structure capacities, the sizing
//! field's factors) lives here, grouped and documented, so the meshing recipe is
//! tunable from one place rather than scattered across modules. Pure structural
//! data shared by several modules (the tet face table) is here too, to remove
//! duplication. Algorithm-internal sentinels (`NONE`, bit masks, the FP splitter)
//! stay with their algorithms; constants of the lower crates (`rapidmesh-exact`,
//! `-geom`, `-csg`) stay there -- the dependency direction forbids one file across
//! crates, and they are not mesher tuning knobs.
