//! Boundary fidelity: how faithfully a mesh reproduces its input PLC.
//!
//! The quality diagnostics ([`crate::diagnostics`]) measure the tets and
//! check that the surface is closed, but a closed surface can still miss part
//! of the geometry (a crater where a region was lost) or smear a crease, and
//! their surface checks only see curved analytic surfaces. This module
//! compares the two surfaces geometrically, without trusting any face label:
//! - the mesh interfaces (where the tet region changes, where the tets end,
//!   and sheet faces) against the PLC facets, in both directions, and on a
//!   curved analytic face against its carrier (the facets are its chords);
//! - the sharp edges of the PLC against the sharp edges of the mesh.
//!
//! Distances are relative to the local mesh size, the longest edge of the
//! nearest mesh interface face. Two surfaces match where they are closer than
//! [`FIDELITY_REL`] of it.
