//! Local improvement of a finished complex: the few tets below a dihedral
//! target are repaired by 2-3 and 3-2 flips and by moving their free
//! vertices, each change accepted only when it raises the worst dihedral
//! among the tets it touches.
//!
//! Every change keeps what the mesher guarantees: tets stay positively
//! oriented, no flip removes a face (boundary, interface or sheet) or a
//! feature edge, and flips stay inside one region. Volume vertices on no
//! face move freely, vertices on one patch move along its carrier without
//! turning a face; the rest stay. With a shape, a flat tet on a boundary
//! may also be peeled off (or across an interface), which flips a surface
//! edge. No change makes a surface face bridge its carrier. Work is
//! proportional to the bad tets, not to the mesh; a new tet takes the
//! place of a dead one, so the arrays keep the mesh's size.
//!
//! Last comes a relaxation of the surface for its triangles, whose shape
//! the tets on the boundary follow (gmsh's lead in the mean dihedral came
//! from there): vertices on one smooth patch go toward the centroid of
//! their faces, vertices inside a smooth curve toward the midpoint of
//! their neighbours, where the smallest angle around them rises, their
//! faces stray no further from the carriers, no tet at the target falls
//! below it, none below gets worse and the mean of their star does not
//! fall.
