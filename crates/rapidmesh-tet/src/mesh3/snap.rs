//! The refinement runs on an exact discrete model (a PLC); the analytic
//! carriers and curves it approximates come back here. Each curve and patch
//! vertex moves to its projection onto its [`Shape`], curves before patches,
//! as far as every incident tet stays positively oriented and none drops
//! below `FLOOR_DEG` (or below where its star already was): the full
//! move, else the largest of a few halvings, else none. Labels, faces and
//! connectivity never change, so every invariant but orientation carries
//! over, and orientation is checked exactly. The moves run on the index of
//! [`super::improve`], which snaps again what stayed short once it has
//! reshaped the star ([`super::improve::finish`]).
//!
//! A volume vertex that ended up on faces of one patch only (a cell point
//! inserted so close to the surface that the surface points meant to
//! replace it were rejected as its duplicates) is a surface sample in all
//! but name: it becomes a vertex of that patch first, and snaps with the
//! rest.
